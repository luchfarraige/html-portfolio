<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a Senior SharePoint Consultant working in Irish Public Sector.</p>

<p>I have over 20+ years experience in development and analysis across all areas of an SDLC.<br/>
I have worked extensively with both AGILE and Waterfall methodologies and have worked numerous roles within development teams.

<p>
Although, I have "maintenance" level experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript, I figured
it was now time to fomarlize this a bit more. I am currently taking Angela Yu's 
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=ACCAGE0923">The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp</a>
course, in order to formalize and round-out my web development toolkit.
